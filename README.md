# Yet another roguelike tutorial

Based on tutorials from r/RoguelikeDev

## Day 0
It starts from choosing the enviroment. 
I started project in ZeroBrane Studio, but suddenly became aware about [kickstart.nvim](https://youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o) project by TJ DeVries.  
It, with some [advices](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) from ThePrimeagen, pushed me deep in a rabbit hole.  
I learned a fair share about NeoVim, it's plugins, some new stuff about fuzzy-finder and tree-sitter, realized that LSP are a new norm, so a lot.

All this time i wasn't making progress. 
Single _@_ sign was moving slowly and lonely in labyrinth made from a single wall strunged across screen. 

Tomorrow. Tomorrow i will hike through Roguelike tutorial blazingly fast, you'll see.
